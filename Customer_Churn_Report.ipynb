    "> ### Untill recently, business solutions were not solely based on infomation sourced from data. However, this pattern of thinking is rapidly changing and more and more companies are adapting to the idea of inferring meaning and descisions from data- including our competitors. Therefore it is paramount that we complie to change also and adapt applications of statistics and computer science in understanding our customer's behaviors. In this particular case- an observed increase in customer attrition as observed by the sales department. Key features to be modeled in this project are:\n",
    " >- Relationships of churned customers among the varius classifications of our key services\n",
    " >- Whether our pricing, payment methods offered and length of tenure creates a pettern with attrition\n",
    " >- How other factors directly related to the customer such as whether if they are senior citizens or not, what if they have dependents or not affect these observations \n"
